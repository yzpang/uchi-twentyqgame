*Last updated in 2016*

How to play: After `make`, type in `./qgame` in command line.

Reading tree from file: `./qgame <input-file>` where `<input-file>` contains an existing tree structure of questions and guesses. See `input-info.txt` for example. The first question on each line corresponds to parent node. The second and third questions correspond to left and right children, respectively.
